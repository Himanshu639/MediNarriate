Lena had always been good at pretending. She’d been pretending for so long that sometimes she forgot what was real. College had started to feel like a game she wasn’t entirely sure how to play. Her friends were all busy—some chasing internships, some chasing parties, and some chasing something even more elusive: themselves. Meanwhile, Lena felt like she was standing still, watching everyone else rush forward. She had always been the "quiet one" in the group, but lately, she felt like her silence had turned into a kind of loneliness. It wasn’t that she didn’t have dreams. She did. But they were just that: dreams. Vague, distant images of who she could be. She loved writing, but when she tried to sit down and put her thoughts into words, it felt like the page was too heavy. Like her thoughts weren’t worth writing down. Maybe everyone felt like that? Maybe she was just overthinking it. Then, one Friday evening, Lena found herself at an art exhibit her roommate had dragged her to. The walls were full of paintings and sculptures, each one more abstract than the last. A few pieces were beautiful, others were strange, and some seemed like they were trying too hard. But one painting, in particular, caught her eye. It was a swirl of colors—reds, blues, and golds—that looked like a storm had collided with a sunrise. Standing in front of it, Lena felt her heart speed up. There was something raw about it. The chaos, the calm, the blending of both. It made her feel something she couldn’t explain—like the world was both infinite and right in front of her at the same time. She stood there for a long while, just looking, until the crowd around her started to thin. A woman who seemed like she could have been the artist herself approached her, a kind smile on her face. “Do you like it?” the woman asked. Lena blinked, caught off guard. “Yeah, it’s... amazing.” The woman nodded. “It’s meant to show that you can’t really separate the messy parts of life from the beautiful ones. They mix together. The chaos is where you find the clarity.” Lena looked back at the painting, suddenly seeing it differently. For the first time in a while, she felt like someone understood. Like someone saw that the messiness inside her wasn’t something to hide or run from, but something that could create beauty. After a moment, the woman added, “You’re an artist, too, aren’t you? You have the look of someone who’s trying to figure something out.” Lena hesitated. “I... I write. But it doesn’t always come out the way I want it to. It’s like I’m stuck.” The woman smiled knowingly. “The key isn’t in forcing things. It’s in letting the words flow when they want to. Just show up, and the rest will follow. Don’t be afraid of the mess.” Lena laughed softly, unsure if the woman was talking about art or life. “Thanks,” she said, still unsure of what to make of the conversation. But for the first time in a while, Lena felt a spark of something—possibility, maybe. A few weeks later, Lena found herself in front of her laptop again, fingers hovering over the keys. She had a million thoughts she could write about, but she didn’t want to force anything. Instead, she started typing about the painting. About the storm, the sunrise, and how they were the same thing. The words flowed in a way she hadn’t expected. When she finished, she sat back and read through what she had written. It wasn’t perfect, but it didn’t have to be. She felt... alive, in a way she hadn’t in a long time. She wasn’t stuck anymore. The messy parts of her life were part of her story—part of the art. And that was something she could work with.
